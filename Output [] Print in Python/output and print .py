#Let us output a number in Python.

#Some code has been populated in the IDE on the right.

#This code just prints 12 on the screen when you run it.

#Click on Submit below the IDE to know the result. Then click on next to continue.


print (12)


#In the last problem, we saw how to print a number (using print).

#Now let's see how to output some text.
#There is only one difference. All textual content should start and end with double quotes.
#For eg -

print("I love Python")

#In the editor we have written half code for you. Some portion of the code contains __ (underscores). Remove those underscore and write 21 in place of first underscore and 40 in place of the next underscore.

#To pass this exercise, your code has to print the sum of 21 and 40.



#You may have noticed the 1st line in the editor having instructions for you. These lines are not code, they are called comments. Comments in Python start with a #. You can write anything inside a common

print(21 + 40)

# Which line of code will output the text Hi?

print("Hi")

# Which lines of code will output the sum of 7 and 19?

print (7 + 19)
